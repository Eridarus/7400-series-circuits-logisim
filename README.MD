This project is an attempt to fill out some of the missing 7400-series logic chips for Logisim that other libraries are missing.

Currently in the library are:

74xx23
74xx36
74xx43
74xx53
74xx60
74HC595

Any mistakes in the chips are probably my fault. I have tried to standardize them. Real pinouts are used (where multiple exist, I have tried to use the most common ones).

Note that I skipped over repetitive chips (like how the 74xx11 is just the 74xx10 but with open-collector outputs).

Feel free to use any of these in your own simulations, and request chips to be added.
